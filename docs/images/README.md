- Ensure no personal/sensitive information is visible
- Use a consistent browser/device for uniformity
- Consider using tools like [Cleanshot](https://cleanshot.com/) for annotations

### GIFs
- Keep file size under 5MB (use compression tools like [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/))
- Duration: 5-15 seconds per GIF
- Frame rate: 15-30 FPS
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or scaled proportionally
- Use tools like [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) or [Kap](https://getkap.co/)

### Diagrams
- Use tools like [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) or [draw.io](https://draw.io)
- Export as PNG with transparent background
- Ensure text is readable at 100% zoom

## Capturing Tips

1. **Clear browser cache** before taking screenshots for clean UI
2. **Use incognito/private mode** to avoid extensions interfering
3. **Prepare seed data** that looks realistic (real food images, proper names)
4. **Use consistent user accounts** for uniformity across screenshots
5. **Capture at key moments** (e.g., hover states, loading states)
